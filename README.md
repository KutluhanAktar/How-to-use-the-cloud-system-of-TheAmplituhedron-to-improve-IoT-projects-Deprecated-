> I recently developed my portfolio website — kutluhanaktar.com — from scratch and decided to migrate all of my codebase to GitHub to provide a simple and straightforward experimentation or replication method for my proof-of-concept projects. Nonetheless, since I focused on demonstrating my thought process and experiment results thoroughly in the written tutorial format, including but not limited to PCB and 3D model designing steps, I could not provide enough information to fully explain my concepts and instructions via GitHub descriptions only. Thus, I highly recommend inspecting the associated project tutorials and videos on my portfolio website or other platforms (maker communities), i.e., Hackster, Hackaday, and Instructables.

# Description

Bring your ideas to life without considering that how to program a server to create a host for web communication using TheAmplituhedron.

# Original Project Publication Date

**February 23, 2018**

# Inspect the project tutorial on:

- **[kutluhanaktar.com](https://www.kutluhanaktar.com/projects/How_to_use_the_cloud_system_of_TheAmplituhedron_com_to_improve_IoT_projects/)**
- **[Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/kutluhan-aktar/how-to-use-theamplituhedron-com-to-improve-iot-projects-d00dd3)**

# Disclaimer

As of 2024, I terminated all subscription-based services of my previous and more experimental website — ***theamplituhedron.com***. Thus, you need to host a similar web application on your server to replicate all of the features mentioned in the project tutorial.
